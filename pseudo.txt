function generate_random_item(arr):
    // do something
    item = Math.random()
    return item

function generate_schedules(selected_days):
    // returns schedule for the days
    // eg: selected_days = ['friday', 'monday']
    // get the list of days
    final_schedule_arr = []
    if selected_days is undefined:
        selected_days = get_selected_days()
      
    for day in selected_days:...we are in a loop here
        schedule = generate_random_item(arr)
        schedule_for_a_particular_day = {
            'name_of_day': day, 
            'activities: [schedule]
        }
        final_schedule_arr.push(schedule_for_a_particular_day)

    return final_schedule_arr

    why the argument in the generate_random_item
    i dont really understand line 7
    you said get the selected days as a list but if you do that you wont be able to loop through it
     how will i know the days that were checked
     how do i get the days that were selected
    where do i get to remove the activity been pushed to the day

    for mw i think it should be inside the generate random item function because for each time its called to generate
    an activity it goes through the function from the beginning
